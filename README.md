Repository for Open Drone Ground Control Station

The Open Drone Project is aimed at developing commercial grade drones that depend entirely on open-source software and hardware. This repository provides source code for the following:

a. The Ground Control Station. The GCS is an interface between the drone operator and the drone. Software and harward artifacts provide the necessary interface and relay mechanisms for drone operators to excute command and control over their drone. This includes tasks like guidance, relay of real-time telemetry to mention but a few. This interface relies on 3D visualization using NASA World Wind Maps, and generated 3D terrain using Open Drone Map.

b. The Open Drone Data Visualization Portal is going to fork this project, and concentrate on data visualization and eliminate command and control features offered by the GCS. Additional capability will be:
  i. Visualization of historical aerial missions, simulations and flight plans.
  ii. Manipulation to filter out relevant data concerning particular sensor data, such as superimposing atmospheric data with terrain maps.
  iii. Analytics like volumetric analysis and related phototgrammetric capabilities including distance measures, object dimension calculation etc.
